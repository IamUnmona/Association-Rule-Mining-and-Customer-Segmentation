# Association-Rule-Mining-and-Customer-Segmentation
This project delves into the applications of association rule mining and customer segmentation analytics. The primary aim is to harness data-driven insights to uncover patterns and segmentations that can inform strategic business decisions.
Association Rule Mining:
I analyze transaction data from a storeâ€™s Stationary and Health and Beauty Aids departments to discover relationships between different products. Utilizing the Apriori algorithm, I identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules based on confidence and lift metrics. This analysis helps in understanding customer purchasing patterns, optimizing product placement, and developing targeted marketing strategies.

Customer Segmentation:
Using data from a U.K. bank, I apply various clustering techniques, including hierarchical and k-means clustering, to categorize customers into distinct groups. This segmentation is based on several demographic and financial attributes such as age, income, and savings behavior. The goal is to tailor bank promotions and services to the needs and preferences of each customer group, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Outcome:
The project seeks to provide actionable insights that can be leveraged to improve product cross-selling strategies and personalize customer engagement, ultimately driving increased sales and customer retention.
